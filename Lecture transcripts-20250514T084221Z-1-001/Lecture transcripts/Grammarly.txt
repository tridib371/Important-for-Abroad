                  IMPORTANT!!!
 These rules are important due to the recent server upgrades by the grammarly team. Any flouting of these rules 
would lead to permanent loss of your premium access.


Instructions on operating the account:
1. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOGIN USING A VPN.

2. DO NOT LOGOUT AFTER YOUR FIRST SUCCESSFUL LOGIN.

3. THE LOGIN  EMAIL OR PASSWORD SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED OR TAMPARED WITH.

4. AFTER WORKING ON A DOCUMENT, CLICK ON CTRL +A ON YOUR KEYBOARD TO HIGHLIGHT THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, CLICK ON CTRL +X  TO CUT IT. 
OPEN A NEW MS WORD OR NOTEPAD PAGE AND PASTE THE DOCUMENT THERE USING  CTRL +V. YOU CAN THEN GO AHEAD TO SAVE IT ON YOUR PC.
DO NOTE THAT GRAMMARLY ISNT A STORAGE MEDIUM WHERE YOU SAVE YOUR DOCUMENTS AS THESE JUNKS TEND TO 
SLOW DOWN THE SERVERS AND DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE ADMINS ON SUCH ACCOUNTS.

5. DO KEEP YOUR LOGIN DETAILS SAFE AND DO NOT SHARE THEM WITH ANYONE.
IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD NOT OFFER ANY FURTHER SUPPORT  IN THE CASE OF THE ACCOUNT BEING BANNED OR RESTRICTED AS A RESULT OF
 FLOUTING ANY OF THE ABOVE RULES.
GOODLUCK
